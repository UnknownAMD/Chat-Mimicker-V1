# Chat Mimicker V1

This is a small open-source script that allows your character to mimic someone else's chat logs. I created this for my brother since the ones on YouTube are often obfuscated and don't work reliably. I wanted to make an open-source version that anyone could use. Please don't remove any credits if you decide to modify it.

## Usage:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UnknownAMD/Chat-Mimicker-V1/main/main.lua",true))()
```
If your executor doesn't support loadstrings, you can use the script directly:
